Abracadabra, abracadabra
Abracadabra, abracadabra

Pay the toll to the angels
Drawing circles in the clouds
Keep your mind on the distance
When the devil turns around

Hold me in your heart tonight
In the magic of the dark moonlight
Save me from this empty fight
In the game of life
Like a poem said by a lady in red
You hear the last few words of your life
With a haunting dance, now you're both in a trance
It's time to cast your spell on the night

Abracadabra, amor-ooh-na-na
Abracadabra, morta-ooh-ga-ga
Abracadabra, abra-ooh-na-na
In her tongue, she said, "Death or love tonight"

Abracadabra, abracadabra
Abracadabra, abracadabra
Feel the beat under your feet, the floor's on fire
Abracadabra, abracadabra

Choose the road on the west side
As the dust flies, watch it burn
Don't waste time on a feeling
Use your passion, no return

Hold me in your heart tonight
In the magic of the dark moonlight
Save me from this empty fight
In the game of life
Like a poem said by a lady in red
You hear the last few words of your life
With a haunting dance, now you're both in a trance
It's time to cast your spell on the night

Abracadabra, amor-ooh-na-na
Abracadabra, morta-ooh-ga-ga
Abracadabra, abra-ooh-na-na
In her tongue, she said, "Death or love tonight"

Abracadabra, abracadabra
Abracadabra, abracadabra
Feel the beat under your feet, the floor's on fire
Abracadabra, abracadabra

Phantom of the dance floor, come to me
Sing for me a sinful melody

Abracadabra, amor-ooh-na-na
Abracadabra, morta-ooh-ga-ga
Abracadabra, abra-ooh-na-na
In her tongue, she said, "Death or love tonight"

Lovers kiss in a garden made of thorns
Traces of lonely words, illusions torn

You said, "How does a man like me love a woman like you?"
I said, "Hold me until I die and I'll make you brand new"

Come on and wrap that blade of grass
Around my finger like a cast
'Cause even though the church burned down
I'll be your queen without a crown
I've been so lonely in this field
Fightin' a battle with no shield
Come on and wrap that blade of grass
And we'll make it last

This is the lawn of memories I mourn
I fall into your eyes, shelter from storm

You said, "How does a man like me love a woman like you?"
I said, "Hold me until I die and I'll make you brand new"

Come on and wrap that blade of grass
Around my finger like a cast
'Cause even though the church burned down
I'll be your queen without a crown
I've been so lonely in this field
Fightin' a battle with no shield
Come on and wrap that blade of grass
And we'll make it last
Come on and wrap that blade of grass
And we'll make it last

I'll give you something
Yeah, it's no diamond ring
The air that I'm breathing
Forever's not enough
A song we'll both sing
Yeah, it's not the same thing
Yeah, it's not the same thing
Forever's not enough

Come on and wrap that blade of grass
Around my finger like a cast
'Cause even though the church burned down
I'll be your queen without a crown
I've been so lonely in this field
Fightin' a battle with no shield
Come on and wrap that blade of grass
Come on and wrap that blade of grass
Come on and wrap that blade of grass
And we'll make it last
Come on and wrap that blade of grass
And we'll make it last

(Ooh, ooh)

I, I just woke up from a dream
Where you and I had to say goodbye
And I don't know what it all means
But since I survived, I realized

Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you

(Ooh, ooh)

Ooh, lost, lost in the words that we scream
I don't even wanna do this anymore
'Cause you already know what you mean to me
And our love's the only war worth fighting for

Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you

Right next to you
Next to you
Right next to you
Oh-oh

If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you

(Ooh, ooh)
I'd wanna be next to you

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah

There are no more tears to cry
I heard you beggin' for life
Runnin' out of medicine
You're worse than you've ever been

(Ah-ah) Screamin' for me, baby
(Ah-ah) Like you're gonna die
(Ah-ah) Poison on the inside, I could be your antidote tonight
(Ah-ah) Screamin' for me, baby
(Ah-ah) Like you're gonna die
(Ah-ah) Poison on the inside, I could be your antidote tonight

I could play the doctor, I can cure your disease
If you were a sinner, I could make you believe
Lay you down like one, two, three
Eyes roll back in ecstasy
I can smell your sickness, I can cure ya
Cure your disease

You're so tortured when you sleep
Plagued with all your memories
You reach out, and no one's there
Like a God without a prayer

(Ah-ah) Screamin' for me, baby
(Ah-ah) Like you're gonna die
(Ah-ah) Poison on the inside, I could be your antidote tonight
(Ah-ah) Screamin' for me, baby
(Ah-ah) Like you're gonna die
(Ah-ah) Poison on the inside, I could be your antidote tonight

I could play the doctor, I can cure your disease
If you were a sinner, I could make you believe
Lay you down like one, two, three
Eyes roll back in ecstasy
I can smell your sickness, I can cure ya

Cure your disease
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
I can smell your sickness, I can cure ya

Bring me your desire, I can cure your disease
If you were a sinner, I could make you believe
Lay you down like one, two, three
Eyes roll back in ecstasy
I know all your secrets, I can cure ya
Ah, cure your disease

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
Cure your disease
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Don't call tonight, don't call tonight, don't call tonight

I can't believe all the things that you said
To me tonight, to me tonight, to me tonight
Stars are descending, the street signs go by
A lonely ride, I need to cry to feel alive

You pull me close and knock me down
Then I beg to come back around
I'm so addicted to your lies, oh
And in the mirror I get weak
At the girl starin' back at me
They're your eyes, they're your eyes

Don't call tonight, unless you wanna hurt me
Don't call tonight, it's not because you care
Don't call tonight, tomorrow you'll desert me
I can hear everything you're sayin' from here

Don't call tonight, don't call tonight

Saturday morning, my head is on fire
It's hard to blame you for your crimes when I have mine
The sun is risin', but we're out of light
We twist the knife too many times to say goodbye

You pull me close and knock me down
Then I beg to come back around
I'm so addicted to your lies, oh
And in the mirror I get weak
At the girl starin' back at me
They're your eyes, they're your eyes

Don't call tonight, unless you wanna hurt me
Don't call tonight, it's not because you care
Don't call tonight, tomorrow you'll desert me
I can hear everything you're sayin' from here

Don't call tonight, don't call tonight, don't call tonight
Oh-oh, oh
Don't call tonight, don't call tonight, don't call tonight

Drivin' home to your favorite song
And you scream so loud, 'cause you're all alone
And your heart beats fast 'cause you're in the zone
And you know you're right where you belong
Drivin' home to your favorite song
And you scream so loud, 'cause you're all alone
And your heart beats fast 'cause you're in the zone
And then you hear the phone

Don't call tonight, unless you wanna hurt me
Don't call tonight, it's not because you care
Don't call tonight, tomorrow you'll desert me
I can hear everything you're sayin' from here (Don't call tonight, yeah)
Don't call tonight, unless you wanna hurt me
Don't call tonight, it's not because you care
Don't call tonight, tomorrow you'll desert me
I can hear everything you're sayin' from here

Don't call tonight, don't call tonight, don't call tonight, oh-oh
Don't call tonight, don't call tonight, don't call tonight
Don't call tonight, yeah-oh-oh
Don't call tonight, don't call tonight, don't call tonight

Ah-ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh-oh

Go get your friends and meet me on the floor
You're out of candy? I can get you mo-o-ore
You start to slur and, and I start to squeal
I'm fallin' over in my nine-inch heels

Come on
(So hit the lights) Come on and hit me, come on
(DJ, hit the lights) DJ, come on
(So hit the lights) Come on and hit me, come on
(DJ, hit the lights)

I could be your girlfriend for the weekend
You could be my boyfriend for the night
My excuse to make a bad decision
Bodies gettin' close under the lights
(Oh) I've been feelin' this familiar feeling
Like I've known you my whole life
(Oh) Take you to the Garden of Eden
Poison apple, take a bite (Oh)

I'll t-t-take you to the Garden of Eden (Uh, uh)
I'll t-t-take you to the Garden of Eden (Oh)
I'll t-t-take you to the Garden of Eden (Uh, uh)
I'll t-t-take you to the Garden of Eden

You're turnin' green from the adrenaline
This chick's a machine, but her friend is way more fun
But you can't hear her with the music on
So you say "yes" and then the party's o-on

Come on
(So hit the lights) Come on and hit me, come on
(DJ, hit the lights)

I could be your girlfriend for the weekend
You could be my boyfriend for the night
My excuse to make a bad decision
Bodies getting close under the lights
(Oh) I've been feelin' this familiar feeling
Like I've known you my whole life
(Oh) Take you to the Garden of Eden
Poison apple, take a bite (Oh)

I'll t-t-take you to the Garden of Eden (Uh, uh)

(DJ, hit the lights) Oh

I could be your girlfriend for the weekend
You could be my boyfriend for the night
My excuse to make a bad decision
Bodies getting close under the lights
(Oh) I've been feelin' this familiar feeling
Like I've known you my whole life
(Oh) Take you to the Garden of Eden
Poison apple, take a bite (Take a bite, oh)

I'll t-t-take you to the Garden of Eden (Uh, uh)
I'll t-t-take you to the Garden of Eden (Oh)
I'll t-t-take you to the Garden of Eden (Uh, uh)

Uh, uh
Ooh
Oh
Yeah

Standin' on the corner, smokin' that grass
And the boys all pass me by
Talkin' some shit with your hand on my ass
I'm a murderer in disguise
Yeah, you wanna be cool, but you're makin' me mad
Bite my lip, it starts to bleed
Yeah, it tastes so good, but I gotta be bad
If I'm gonna get you home

Gonna make the curtains scream, believe it
Gonna make the ceiling shake for me
I'ma be a full-time bedroom demon
I'm gonna make you scream, that's a matter of fact
I'll be your fantasy

I'm a killah
And, boy, you're gonna die tonight
Oh, killah, killah, killah, killah
I'm a killah
And, boy, you're gonna die tonight
Oh, killah, killah, killah, killah
Killah

Im lightin' up my final cigarette
I'll burn a hole right through your eyes
Lookin' at you like a zombie killah
Hungry for a homicide
If I get you alone under your skin and bone
I'ma try you on for size
I'm 'bout to wear you out like my favorite suit
Wools paralyzed

Gonna make the curtains cream, believe it
Gonna make the ceiling shake for me
I'ma be a full-time bedroom demon
I'm gonna make you scream, that's a matter of fact
I'll be your fantasy

I'm a killah
And, boy, you're gonna die tonight
Oh, killah, killah, killah, killah

Need your love, your love drug, your love drug
Need your love drug

River in my eyes, I've got a poem in my throat
I hear the music and it takes me by surprise
Pictures in my mind, they come on faster than they go
Another round, hopin' this one will make me blind

I know this time
I won't escape these thoughts in my head
I need you tonight
But I'm gonna fight the feeling instead

I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna cry
So I'm gonna dance until I feel alright
I just need a dose of the right stuff
I just need a hit of your love drug
I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna cry
So I'm gonna dance until I feel alright
I just need a dose of the right stuff
I just need a hit of your love drug

Your love drug

Thought we'd last a lifetime, when I'm mumblin' alone
I taste the last words that you spoke to me like wine
My heart is in a bind, if I could bear it on my own
I wouldn't try so hard to numb what's left behind

I know this time
I won't escape these thoughts that I dread
I need you tonight
But I'm gonna fight the feeling instead

I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna cry
So I'm gonna dance until I feel alright
I just need a dose of the right stuff
I just need a hit of your love drug
I don't wanna feel, I don't wanna cry
So I'm gonna dance until I feel alright
I just need a dose of the right stuff
I just need a hit of your love drug

Love drug
Need your love, your love drug, your love drug
Need your love drug, need your love drug

Love drug
I just need a dose of the right stuff
I just need a hit of your love drug

Oh, ooh, ah
Uh

I'm made of plastic like a human doll
You push and pull me, I don't hurt at all
I talk in circles, 'cause my brain, it aches
You say, "I love you", I disintegrate

I've become a notorious being
Find my clone, she's asleep on the ceiling
Now, can't get me down
You love to hate me
I'm the perfect celebrity

So rip off my face in this photograph (Perfect celebrity)
You make me money, I'll make you laugh (Perfect celebrity)
Show me your pretty, I'll show you mine
You love to hate me
I'm the perfect celebrity

Uh

I look so hungry, but I look so good
Tap on my vein, suck on my diamond blood
Choke on the fame and hope it gets you high
Sit in the front row, watch the princess die

I've become a notorious being
Find my clone, she's asleep on the ceiling
Now, can't get me down
You love to hate me
I'm the perfect celebrity

So rip off my face in this photograph (Perfect celebrity)
You make me money, I'll make you laugh (Perfect celebrity)
Show me your pretty, I'll show you mine
You love to hate me
I'm the perfect celebrity

Na-na, na-na, na (Perfect celebrity)
Na-na, na-na, na (Perfect celebrity)
Ah-ah, na-na, na-na, na (Perfect celebrity)
Na-na, na-na, na

Catch me as I rebound (Let all the stuff)
Save me, I'm underground (I can't be found)
Hollywood's a ghost town
You love to hate me
I'm the perfect celebrity

So rip off my face in this photograph (Perfect celebrity)
You make me money, I'll make you laugh (Perfect celebrity)
Show me your pretty, I'll show you mine
You love to hate me, you love to hate me

(Na-na, na-na, na, perfect celebrity)
You hate me (Na-na, na-na, na, perfect celebrity)
Show me your pretty, I'll show you mine
You love to hate me

(Sha-da-do, sha-da-do-ow of a man)
(Sha-da-do, sha-da-do-ow)
Dance in the shadow of a m—

Standing in the shadow of another man
Lonely as the streets pass me by (Oh, oh)
Life ain't under pressure 'cause I got a plan
Starin' at myself in the eye (Oh, oh-oh)

When I get this feeling
I can't get enough
'Cause I stop believing
And my voice gets cold
Now I got this feeling
I can't get enough
'Cause I won't be used for my love and left out to cry

I don't wanna fade into the darkness tonight
Show me the light
I don't wanna be the one to fall on the knife
To come alive
I'm about to be there, I'm about to be there
Watch me, I swear I'll
Dance in the shadow of a man

Hard to be the yellow in a purple sky (Sky)
Peekin' through the eye of the storm (Eye of the storm)
Gotta be the truth or you'll become a lie (Become a lie)
Piercing like your skin from a thorn (Oh, oh, I)

When I get this feeling
I can't get enough
'Cause I stop believing
And my voice gets cold
Now I got this feeling
I can't get enough
'Cause I won't be used for my love and left out to cry

I don't wanna fade into the darkness tonight
Show me the light
I don't wanna be the one to fall on the knife
To come alive
I'm about to be there, I'm about to be there
Watch me, I swear I'll
Dance in the shadow of a man

Sha-da-do, sha-da-do-ow (Shadow of a man)
Sha-da-do, sha-da-do-ow of a man
Sha-da-do, sha-da-do-ow (Shadow of a man)
Dance in the shadow of a man

Can't ignore the voice within
And a woman can't lose, but you still pretend
Can't ignore the voice within
And a woman can't lose, but you still pretend
Can't ignore the voice within
And a woman can't lose, but you still pretend
'Cause I won't be used for my love and left out to cry

I don't wanna fade into the darkness tonight
Show me the light
I don't wanna be the one to fall on the knife
I'm 'bout to come alive
I'm about to be there, I'm about to be there
Watch me, I swear I'll
Dance in the shadow of a man

Sha-da-do, sha-da-do-ow (Shadow of a man)
Sha-da-do, sha-da-do-ow of a man
Sha-da-do, sha-da-do-ow (Shadow of a man)
Dance in the shadow of a man

Turn on the music

I touch your face 'cause I see panic, who rang the alarm?
I see you shivering, your eyes are red, your soul is gone
You're out of breath, tick-tock, tick-tock, you're almost out of time, yeah, yeah
Because at midnight, there's a change in you that I have heard
You've kept this secret for so long, you whisper and it burns
You're out of breath, tick-tock, tick-tock, you're almost out of time, yeah, yeah

You can't hide who you are, 11:59
Your heart's racin', you're growlin' and we both know why
Yeah, we both know why

Turn on the music
Turn off the lights
I wanna feel the beast inside
I know you're hungry, ready to bite
I wanna watch you turn tonight
I wanna feel the beast inside

The girls are scared of you, a legend in your neighborhood
Last week, you left somebody dead, you're so misunderstood
You got your hands on Little Red, tick-tock, you're out of time, oh yeah, ooh

You can't hide who you are, 11:59
Your heart's racin', you're growlin' and we both know why
Yeah, we both know why

Saw your face and mine
In a picture by our bedside
It was cold in the summertime

High on a hill, you called
Two lovers regret their time
Once in a blue moon, I forget you
And once in your life, you'll be mine

Do you see me? Do you see me now?
I've been waitin' for you, cryin' out
Do you see me? Do you see me now?

Saw your face and mine
In a picture by our bedside
It was cold in the summertime
We were happy just to be alive
Can I vanish into you?
Can I vanish into you? (Yah)

Into the night, we fly
Sirens blow by our heads (Yah)

Do you see me? Do you see me now?
I've been waitin' for you, cryin' out
Do you see me? Do you see me now?

Saw your face and mine
In a picture by our bedside
It was cold in the summertime
We were happy just to be alive
Can I vanish into you?
Can I vanish into you?

(Yah)

Saw your face and mine
In a picture by, by, by, by my bedside
It was cold in the summertime
We were happy just to be alive
Can I, I vanish into you?
Can I vanish into you? (Can I? Can I?)
Like a ghost, I, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, vanish into you
Can I vanish into you?

When I die, can I vanish into you?

We about to be up all night, wakin' up a zombie
So put your paws all over me, you zombieboy, you zombieboy

See you over there in the back of this party
And your girlfriend isn't here (Yeah, your girlfriend isn't here)
Boy inside a cage, lookin' angry and tired
Like you've been up for days (Like you've been up for days)

'Cause you're an animal, an animal
And you're closin' in on me
Yeah, you're an animal, an animal
And it just can't be this way

Oh, I can't see straight and my hands are tied
I could be your type from your zombie bite
No, I can't see straight but the feeling's right
I could be your type from your zombie bite

We about to be up all night, wakin' up a zombie
So put your paws all over me, you zombieboy

Think you're really sly, like a lion on the hunt for
This kitten over here, this kitten over here (Meow)
Bar is gettin' dry, and you starin' at the sunrise
Bet you're thirsty over there (Bet you're thirsty over there)

'Cause you're an animal, an animal
And you're closin' in on me (You animal)
Yeah, you're an animal, an animal
And it just can't be this way

Oh, I can't see straight and my hands are tied
I could be your type from your zombie bite
No, I can't see straight but the feeling's right
I could be your type from your zombie bite

Put your paws all over me, you zombieboy
Put your paws all over me, you zombieboy

I don't want you to stay (I don't want you to stay)
But I can't watch you walk away (Watch you walk away)
I'll think about you in my dreams (See you in my dreams)
You're better off a fantasy (A fantasy, a fantasy)
Fantasy (My fantasy, my fantasy)
Goodbye, I'll see you in my dreams

Oh, I can't see straight and my hands are tied
I could be your type from your zombie bite
No, I can't see straight but the feeling's right
I could be your type from your zombie bite

We about to be up all night, wakin' up a zombie
So put your paws all over me, you zombieboy
We about to be up all night, wakin' up a zombie
So put your paws all over me, you zombieboy
