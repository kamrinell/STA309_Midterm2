I killed my former and
Left her in the trunk on Highway 10
Put the knife under the hood
If you find it, send it straight to Hollywood
Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha-ha
A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a
Aura-a-a-a, aura-a-a-a
Aura-a-a-a, aura-a-a-a
Aura-a-a-a, aura-a-a-a

I'm not a wandering slave, I am a woman of choice
My veil is protection for the gorgeousness of my face
You ought to pity me 'cause was arranged one man to love
But in the bedroom, the size of him's more than enough

Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura, behind the aura?
Do you wanna touch me, cosmic lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?
Behind the aura, behind the aura, behind the aura?

Enigma popstar is fun, she wear burqa for fashion
It's not a statement as much as just a move of passion
I may not walk on your street or shoot a gun on your soil
I hear you screaming, is it because of pleasure or toil?

Dance, sex, art, pop, tech
Dance, sex, art, pop, tech

Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura, behind the aura?
Do you wanna touch me, cosmic lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?
Behind the aura, behind the curtain, behind the burqa

(Last night) Our lovers' quarrel
(I was thinkin' about you) Hurts more than I can say
(And it was kind of dirty) All night
(And the way that you looked at me)
Help me here (It was kind of nasty, aah!)
Help me here (It was kind of trashy)
'Cause I can't help my mind from going there

Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you

Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams

We could be caught (I just want this to be perfect)
We're both convicted criminals of thought ('Cause I'm broken)
Let's white (By the one before)
Glove the bed (He was kind of nasty)
Help me here (And I feel so trashy)
'Cause we can't hide the evidence in our heads

Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do (Woo)
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you

Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams

Don't stop the party (Making love in my sex dreams)
Let's keep it naughty, yeah (Making love in my sex dreams)
Watch me act a fool (Making love in my sex dreams)
Tomorrow when I run into you, tomorrow when I run into you

You could turn to stone or the color of men petrified by a woman
In love as I am when I lay with you
I think of him, I think of him

I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple drinks and... oh my God!

Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (You were in my)

Last night
Don't stop the party (Damn, you were in my sex dreams)
Let's keep it naughty, yeah (Doing really nasty things)
Watch me act a fool (Damn, you were in my sex dreams)
Tomorrow when I run into you (Making love in my sex dreams)

Yeah
It's about that time, yeah, haha
Time to take off, partner, alright?
Hustle Gang, uh-huh, G-D-O-D
Get your doe or die, partner
Yup, leggo (Ayy)

Still Bankhead, shawty, yeah, you know what it is
Pockets full of numbers, rubber bands, and bills
Came up from 'round, that's a Dandiville
They finna do a deal, about 60 mil'
You ain't lived that life, you perpetrate
You wasn't really trappin', servin' birds of yay
You ain't have to beat no murder case
Man, you probably couldn't get a O of every day
'Round my way, cats get murder planned
Ain't no rules, play dirty, man
Put somethin' through your jersey, man
If your partner want some, we can do it again
Okay, H-U-S-T-L-E
G-G-G-A-N-G, yeah, that way
Just pull up, pull up, hop out, hop out
All about the dollar, better go and ask Gaga

[Lady Gaga:]
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love

I admit that my habit's expensive
And you may find it quite offensive
But I won't die at the hands of another
I'm your mother, sister, your father, brother
This family is stupid attractive
If you've surveyed the way we've acted
Keep it comin', I'm comin' around like your friend now
I think you should shut up and sit down

Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love
Don't want your jewels, I want your drugs
Want your jewels, I want your drugs
Don't want your money, want your love

[Too $hort:]
Everybody want that money, what you want?
High as hell, tryna have some fuckin' fun
I don't need 'em, but the diamonds make it shine (Shine)
Tried to kick it, just can't find the time
It's the middle of the week, this ain't even the weekend
Red carpet events, every time you see pimps
It's good pussy in the passenger seat
My lil' homies hang with me, I be passin' 'em freaks (Bitch)

[Lady Gaga:]
Jewels and drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em if you wanna be bad
Slap honey on a young pancake
We know how to make that money
Jewels and drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em if you wanna be bad
Ain't nothin' if it ain't family
We know how to make that money

[Twista:]
Come and show me the gateway into your love
I feel like the money can never do it like the club
And I feel like a diamond can never do it like a drug
And I want it so come on and take it with me so that I can hit it
I can admit it, I'm influenced by desire when I approach her
I try to provoke her by givin' money and jewelry and accessories
Instead of the recipe of a legacy of takin' her to another place when I get it
Hold up
Twista be goin' in warp speed, breakin' atoms
Blowin' O.G. has got me creating antimatter
Let her pop it and smoke on it with me, now I got her
Because she be ready to party and then move to the club (Yes)
Because you know the way I think is an anomaly
And I'ma be strange as Lady Gaga
Probably a dollar be the business
But I'd rather be in an outer dimension when I be talkin' about jewels and drugs

[Lady Gaga:]
Jewels and drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em if you wanna be bad
Slap honey on a young pancake
We know how to make that money
Jewels and drugs, play that hustle
Smother 'em if you wanna be bad
Ain't nothing if it ain't family
We know how to make that money

Put some lipstick on
Perfume your neck and slip your high heels on
Rinse and curl your hair
Loosen your hips and get a dress to wear
I'm the one who's been coming 'round
Looking to love in you
You're the medicine, I need to heal
The way you make me feel

Touch me in the dark
Put your hands all over my body parts
Throw me on the bed
Squeeze, tease me, please me, that's what I said!
'Cause I'm the trick who's been coming 'round
Looking to love in you
You're the, the medicine
I need to heal the way, the way, the way you make me feel

Ah-ah-ah-ah

Yeah (Oh)
Turn the mic up

Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh (Oh)
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh (Oh)

[Lady Gaga:]
I, I feel good, I walk alone
But then I trip upon myself and I fall
I, I stand up, and then I'm okay
But then you print some shit that makes me wanna scream

So do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, don't stop, let's party
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me
If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want, what you want with my body
What you want with my body

You can't have my heart, and you won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can't stop my voice 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

[R. Kelly:]
Early morning, longer nights (Yeah)
Tom Ford, private flights (Yeah)
Crazy schedule, fast life
I wouldn't trade it in, 'cause it's our life
(But let's slow it down)
I could be the drink in your cup
I could be the green in your blunt, your pusher man
Yeah, I got what you want
You wanna escape (Oh)
All of the crazy shit (Let go)
You're the Marilyn, I'm the president
And I love to hear you sing (Girl)

Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Back of the club, taking shots, gettin' naughty
No invitations, it's a private party
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Do what I want, do what I want with your body
Yeah, we taking these haters and we roughin' 'em up
And we layin' the cut like we don't give a fuck

[Lady Gaga & R. Kelly:]
You can't have my heart, and you won't use my mind (My mind)
But do what you want with my body (Yeah)
Do what you want with my body (With your body)
You can't stop my voice 'cause you don't own my life
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body (Body)

[Lady Gaga:]
Sometimes I'm scared, I suppose
If you ever let me go
I would fall apart if you break my heart
So just take my body and don't stop the party

[Lady Gaga & R. Kelly:]
You can't have my heart and (Help me now)
You won't use my mind
But do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body (With your body)
You can't stop my voice, 'cause
You don't own my life (You)
But do what you want with my body
(What I want, when I want, when I want)
Do what you want with my body

[Lady Gaga:]

Do what you want with me
What you want with my body, world
Help me now
What you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body

Come to me
In all your glamour and cruelty
Just do that thing that you do
And I'll undress you
Keep it tight
Sometimes the simplest move is right
The melody that you choose
Can rescue you

A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My ARTPOP could mean anything

We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP)

Come to me
With all your subtext and fantasy
Just do that thing that you do
In a perverse hue
Lovers' kites
Are flown on beaches for public sight
The color palette you choose
Could profit you

A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My ARTPOP could mean anything
Could try to sell you out or I
Could show you all the reasons why
My ARTPOP could mean anything

We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP)

Brushes of darkness won't help you create your destiny of self
But ARTPOP could mean anything
Anything
I try to sell myself, but I am really laughing
Because I just love the music, not the bling
Music, not the bling

We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP)

We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP)

Free my mind
ARTPOP
You make my
Heart stop

Hush up
Don't speak, don't wanna hear another
(Not another word from you)
You're just an animal, tryna act real special
(But deep down, you're just a shrew)

Maybe I should have a little more just to stay out of my mind
'Cause it's when I'm not thinking with you that I act like a swine
Act like a swine
Act like a swine

I know, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside
Do ya? I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside
Swine, swine
Swine, swine

Swine! Swine!

Be that, hog, sweat it out, you squealer
(Let your body jiggle)
Slap her skin, he loves to watch your ass go wiggle
(It's the thrill of ecstasy)

Maybe I should have a little more just to stay out of my mind
'Cause it's when I'm not thinking with you that I act like a swine
Act like a swine
Act like a swine

I know, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside
Do ya? I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting
You're just a pig inside
Swine, swine

Paint your face and
Paint her face and (Catch the beat)
Paint your face and
Be a swine just (Catch the beat)
For the weekend

Lady of the Dam
Won't be a slave to the blonde, or the culture of the popular
(She won't, she won't)
Sing at you, I'll fly under radar tonight
Make deals with every devil in sight
(I will, I will)

'Cause I love, love, 'cause I love, love
You better than, you better than
My darkest sin
Russian hookers, and cheap gin

I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me and Mary Jane in Holland tonight

Mary! Jane! Holland!
(Woo-hoo!)
Mary! Jane! Holland!
(Oh-hoo!)

I don't like to boast
But our truffles are the most
Mad-magical in Amsterdam
(She won't, she won't)
So if you have fear, Apollo
Sit on my lyre, and play him like a piano, man
(I will, I will)

'Cause I love, love, 'cause I love, love
You better than, you better than
My darkest sin
Russian hookers, and cheap gin

I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me and Mary Jane in Holland tonight

Mary! Jane! Holland!
(Woo-hoo!)
Mary! Jane! Holland!
(Oh-hoo!)

I know that Mom and Dad think I'm a mess
But it's alright, because I am rich as piss
When I ignite the flame and put you in my mouth
The grass eats up my insides, and my brunette starts to sprout
Introducing, ladies and gentlemen, Mary Jane Holland!

I think that I could be fine
If I could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I think we'd have a good time
If you'd meet me and Mary Jane in Holland tonight

Mary! Jane! Holland!

Cork's off, it's on
The party's just begun
I promise this drink is my last one
I know I fucked up again
Because I lost my only friend
God, forgive my sins

Don't leave me, I
Oh, I'll hate myself until I die

My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low from living high for so long
I'm sorry, and I love you
Sing with me, "Bell Bottom Blue"
I'll keep on searching for an answer, 'cause I need you more than dope

I need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
I need you more than dope

Toast, one last puff and two last regrets
Three spirits and twelve lonely steps
Up Heaven's stairway to gold
Mine myself like coal
A mountain of his soul

Each day, I cry
Oh, I feel so low from living high

My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low from living high for so long
I'm sorry, and I love you
Sing with me, "Bell Bottom Blue"
I'll keep on searching for an answer, 'cause I need you more than dope

I need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
I need you more than dope

I need you more
Need you more
I need you more than dope

Sometimes a story has no end
Sometimes I think that we could just be friends
"'Cause I'm a wandering man," he said to me
"And what about the future plans?
Does this thing we have even makes sense
When I got the whole world in front of me?"
So, I said

I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

So I just packed my baggage, and
Said goodbye to family and friends
And took a road to nowhere on my own
Like Dorothy on a yellow brick
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
'Cause I left everyone I love at home

I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm

And then he asked me, he said
"Baby, why do we love each other?"
I said, "Honey, it's simple
It's the way that you love and treat your mother."

Thought that I would be alone forever, but I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home, but I think with you, I could spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Bust the rear view and fire up the jets
'Cause it's you and me
Baby, for life (If you go with me)
For life (See the world with me)

'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy, I'm

Russia, UK, Paris
I'm Italian, Asian kompai
Africa, India, I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy
I'm Latin-American
I don't speak German, but I try
Someday in Jakarta
I'm American, I'm gypsy
I'm Bangkok, Australian, Malaysia
Sweden, Finland, Norway
Be my home just for the day
I'm a gypsy, gypsy, gypsy
Hey (Hey, hey, hey)


I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong
To crash the critic saying, "Is it right or is it wrong?"
If only fame had an IV, baby, could I bear
Being away from you? I found the vein, put it in here

I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)

A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (Make it real loud)
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (Make it real loud)
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch

I've overheard your theory, "Nostalgia's for geeks"
I guess sir, if you say so, some of us just like to read
One second I'm a Koons, then suddenly the Koons is me
Pop culture was in art, now art's in pop culture, in me

I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)

A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (Make it real loud)
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (Make it real loud)
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch

Woo... touch, touch
Woo... touch, touch
Now... woo-oh-oh-oh
Woo-oh-oh-oh

I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
Live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause

Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)

A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (Make it real loud)
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E (Make it real loud)
A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch

A-R-T-P-O-P
