We are the crowd, we're c-comin' out
Got my flash on, it's true
Need that picture of you, it's so magical
We'd be so fantastical
Leather and jeans, garage glamorous
Not sure what it means
But this photo of us, it don't have a price
Ready for those flashing lights
'Cause you know that, baby, I

I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar, you know that I'll be
Your papa-paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous, chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

I'll be your girl backstage at your show
Velvet ropes and guitars
Yeah, 'cause you're my rock star in between the sets
Eyeliner and cigarettes
Shadow is burnt, yellow, dance and we turn
My lashes are dry
Purple teardrops I cry, it don't have a price
Loving you is cherry pie
'Cause you know that, baby, I

I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar, you know that I'll be
Your papa-paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous, chase you down until you love me

Snap, snap to that shit on the radio
Don't stop for anyone
We're plastic, but we still have fun!

I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me

I can't help myself, I'm addicted to a life of material
It's some kind of joke, I'm obsessively opposed to the typical
All we care about is runway models, Cadillacs and liquor bottles
Give me something I wanna be, retro glamour, Hollywood, yes, we live for the

Fame (Fame), doin' it for the fame (Fame)
'Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
Fame (Fame), doin' it for the fame (Fame)
'Cause we got a taste for champagne and endless fortune

Fame, fame, baby, the fame, fame
We live for the fame, fame, baby, the fame, fame
Isn't it a shame, shame, baby? A shame, shame
In it for the fame, fame, baby, the fame, fame

I can see myself in the movies, with my picture in city lights
Photograph my mind and whatever else you'd like to shoot, you decide
All we care about is pornographic girls on film and body plastic
Give me something I wanna see, television and hot blondes in odd positions

Fame (Fame), doin' it for the fame (Fame)
'Cause we wanna live the life of the rich and famous
Fame (Fame), doin' it for the fame (Fame)
'Cause we got a taste for champagne and endless fortune

Fame, fame, baby, the fame, fame

That's M-O-N-E-why so sexy? I

Damn, I love the Jag, the jet, and the mansion
Oh, yeah
And I enjoy the gifts and trips to the islands
Oh, yeah

It's good to live expensive, you know it, but
My knees get weak, intensive

When you give me k-kisses
That's money, honey
When I'm your lover and your mistress
That's money, honey
When you touch me, it's so delicious
That's money, honey
Baby, when you tear me to pieces

That's money, honey
Baby, when you tear me to pieces

You know I 'preciate the finer things
But it's not what makes me happiest, baby (I can do without it, babe)
Your tender loving's more than I can handle
Never burn out this candle, baby, baby

So starstruck, Cherry-Cherry-Cherry Cherry Boom Boom

Rollin' up to the club on the weekend
Styling out to the beat that you're freakin'
Fantasize I'm the track that you're tweakin'
Blow my heart up
Put your hands on my waist, pull the fader
Run it back with original flavor
Cue me up, I'm the 12 on your table

Got your Dre headphones with the left side on
Wanna scratch me back and forth, back and forth? Uh-huh
Put your hands on my waist, pull the fader
Run it back with original flavor

Hey, little mama like "Really, really, is that him?"
I done seen you before, what you got on them big rims?
Enter that cash flow, I'm like, baby, you don't trip
So shawty, say hand over your signature right here
Like adjust the dotted line, and I'm supposed to sign
How she at it, a fanatic and I think it's goin' down
She so starstruck, the gal all stuck
I shoulda had an overdose, too many Starbucks
Ain't never seen a balla, paper that stack taller
Stunners who let the top back on the Chevy Impala
Hummers and all that, fully loaded with two spoilers
What did you call that when you showed up with two dollars?
But that's another chapter, son of a bachelor
All on me, just spotted a baby actor
Complete swagger, there go the dagger
Got what she wants, shawty happily ever after

I'm so starstruck
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up

Hey there, sugar baby, saw you twice at the pop show
You taste just like glitter mixed with rock 'n' roll
I like you a lot, lot, think you're really hot, hot
Know you think you're special when we dance real crazy
Glam-ophonic, electronic, disco, baby
I like you a lot, lot, all we want is hot, hot

Watch your heart when we're together, boys like you love me forever

Midnight rush with a pen in my hand
Inkin' Lincoln, sanskrit with a fan
Rememberin' me before we began
Sometimes I felt so Def in the Jam
But the ones who loved me told me to stop
Like, "Homegirl can't catch shit if it drop"
A superwoman chick, you know that I am
Some shit don't fly by me in a man

'Cause I do not accept any less
Than someone just as real, as fabulous

Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign away my life to
Someone who's got the flavor
But don't have no follow-through
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign no monkey papers
I don't do funny business
Not interested in fakers
Don't want any paper gangsta
Oh-oh
Don't want no paper gangsta
Oh-oh
Don't want no paper gangsta
Don't want no paper gangsta

Got something really shiny to start
Want me to sign there on your Range Rover heart
I've heard it before, yeah, the dinners were nice
'Til your diamond words melted into some ice
You shoulda been rappin' to the beat of my song
Mr. California, paper ganster-a
I'm lookin' for love, not an empty page
Full of stuff that means nothin' but "you've been played"

'Cause I do not accept any less
Than someone just as real, as fabulous

Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign away my life to
Someone who's got the flavor
But don't have no follow-through
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign no monkey papers
I don't do funny business
Not interested in fakers
Don't want no paper gangsta
Oh-oh
Don't want no paper gangsta
Oh-oh
Don't want no paper gangsta (gangsta, gangsta)
Don't want no paper gangsta (gangsta, gangsta, gangsta)

Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign away my life to
Someone who's got the flavor
But don't have no follow-through
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign no monkey papers
I don't do funny business
Not interested in fakers
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign away my life to
Someone who's got the flavor
But don't have no follow-through
Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign no monkey papers
I don't do funny business
Not interested in fakers
Don't want no paper gangsta
Oh-oh
Don't want no paper gangsta
Oh-oh
Don't want no paper gangsta
Don't want no paper gangsta
Don't want no paper gangsta
Don't want no paper gangsta

It's in time with it

In your brown eyes, I walked away
In your brown eyes, I couldn't stay
In your brown eyes, you'll watch her go
Then turn the record on and wonder what went wrong
What went wrong?

If everything was everything, but everything is over
Everything could be everything if only we were older
I guess it's just a silly song about you
And how I lost you and your brown eyes

In your brown eyes, I was feeling low
'Cause they're brown eyes, and you never know
Got some brown eyes, but I saw her face
I knew that it was wrong, so baby, turn the record on
Play that song

Where everything was everything, but everything is over
Everything could be everything if only we were older
I guess it's just a silly song about you
And how I lost you and your brown eyes
Brown eyes

Everything was everything, but baby it's the last show
Everything could be everything, but it's time to say goodbye
So get your last fix and your last hit, grab your old girl with her new tricks
Honey, yeah, it's no surprise that I got lost in your brown eyes
In your brown eyes

Brown, brown eyes
Your brown eyes
Brown, brown eyes
Got some brown eyes
Brown, brown eyes
Your brown eyes

I like it rough

Your love is nothing I can't fight
Can't sleep with the man who dims my shine

I'm in the bedroom with tissues and when
I know you're outside bangin', then I won't let you in
'Cause it's a hard life with love in the world
And I'm a hard girl, loving me's like chewing on pearls

You've got me wondering why I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough, I, I like it rough
You've got me wondering why I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough, I, I like it rough

Won't go without my fix tonight, it's a little too rough
Prom girl wipes her tears with silver lines, and she can't get enough

I'm in the bedroom with tissues and when
I know you're outside banging, then I won't let you in
'Cause it's a hard life with love in the world
And I'm a hard girl, loving me's like straightening curls

You've got me wondering why I, I like it rough (You got me)
I, I like it rough, I, I like it rough
You've got me wondering why I, I like it rough (Oh, yeah)
I, I like it rough, I, I like it rough

I'm shiny and I know it
Don't know why you wanna blow it
Need a man who likes it rough, likes it rough, likes it rough
(Baby likes it rough)
I'm shiny and I know it
Don't know why you wanna blow it
Need a man who likes it rough, likes it rough, likes it rough
(Baby likes it rough)
Is it 'cause you don't mean it, or because I don't feel it unless it's rough?
Is it 'cause you don't mean it, or because I don't feel it unless it's rough?
Lady Gaga

You've got me wondering why I, I like it rough (You've got, yeah, you've got me)
I, I like it rough, I, I like it rough (Oh, wondering why)
You've got me wondering why I, I like it rough (Oh, oh yeah)
I, I like it rough, I, I like it rough (Oh, I like it rough)
You've got me wondering why I, I like it rough (Yeah, you have got me)
I, I like it rough, I, I like it rough (Oh, wondering why)
You've got me wondering why I, I like it rough
I, I like it rough, I, I like it rough
I like it rough
I like it rough
I like it rough
I like it rough

Nowhere, yeah, we're goin' nowhere fast
Maybe this time, I'll be yours, you'll be mine
C-c-c-crazy (Crazy), get your ass in my bed
Baby, you'll be just my summer boyfriend (Summerboy)

Let's get lost, you can take me home
Somewhere nice, we can be alone
Bikini top's comin' o-o-off
Don't be sad when the sun goes down
You'll wake up, and I'm not around
I've got to go, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We'll still have the summer after all
Ooh!

Sometimes you might start a fight
But I'm happy pretending we're alright
Sunglasses cover up my green eyes
My martini glistens, yeah, while checking out other guys (Summerboy)

Let's get lost, you can take me home
Somewhere nice, we can be alone
Bikini top's coming o-o-off
Don't be sad when the sun goes down
You'll wake up, and I'm not around
I've got to go, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We'll still have the summer after all
Ooh!

Hey there, Summerboy, let's go for a drive
Take me for a ride, never gonna close our eyes
Hey there, Summerboy, I'm a busy girl
Don't got too much time, hurry up before I change my mind
Hey there, Summerboy, I'm taking off my heels
Let's go for a run, have a little summer fu-u-un
Have a little summer fu-u-un
(Summerboy)

Let's get lost, you can take me home
Somewhere nice, we can be alone
Bikini top's poppin' o-o-off
Don't be sad when the sun goes down
You'll wake up, and I'm not around
You've got to go, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We'll still have the summer after
Let's get lost, you can take me home
Somewhere nice we can be alone
I've got my summer-summerboy

Take a minute for us and relax, relax
Cupid's got me
Oh, with his bow and arrow, baby
He'll hit you in the pants, hot pants
Get the people to dance and relax, relax

Throw it like those girls in the movies
We've got a show to put on your dress
Take a minute for us and relax, relax

A 300 mirror's burning
Through the hearts of the crowd in the back
Hips just banging the track to the muzak, muzak
