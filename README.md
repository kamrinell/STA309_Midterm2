For this project I looked into the sentiment of lyrics from Lady Gaga. The three albums I looked at were "The Fame", "ARTPOP", and "Mayhem". Mayhem ended up having the most negative sentiment in its lyrics but also being the most popular. However, it is important to note that popularity is determined not just by the amount of plays but also the recency of those plays. 

Word clouds were created for three albums in which we see a lot of themes of love, liking, and we see in the analysis that all albums have fairly high positive sentiment in their lyrics.
 
I then looked at songs with available popularity within "The Fame" Album and it appears that sentiment does not have a clear relationship with how popular a song gets.

For my own additional plot, I also looked at how recency of an album coming out could do to the albums popularity. Instead of a realtionship we can see that certain albums have done well and continue to do well while others despite being more recent than others are not very popular.

Lyrics taken from azlyrics.com and spotify metadata came from the Spotify API using the spoifyr package in RStudio.
